            <p>
                My husband name is shah redwan.I have met many people so far in this life, but the person I enjoy
                remembering the most is my husband Jeff. He was born and raised in Tennessee. He is six feet tall,
                weighs two hundred sixty seven pounds,he has dark brown eyes, and such a nice smile. His hair is jet
                black with just a few silver and white strands throughout. He is a very big and strong character of a
                man. And yet he is the most gentle, kind and caring man that I have ever met.
