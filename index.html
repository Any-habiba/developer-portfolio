            <p>
                My husband name is shah redwan.I have met many people so far in this life, but the person I enjoy
                remembering the most is my husband Jeff. He was born and raised in Tennessee. He is six feet tall,
                weighs two hundred sixty seven pounds,he has dark brown eyes, and such a nice smile. His hair is jet
                black with just a few silver and white strands throughout. He is a very big and strong character of a
                man. And yet he is the most gentle, kind and caring man that I have ever met.

                <h2>Traffic jam</h2>
                <h3 class="green-color">news 21 june 2022</h3>
                <p></p>
                <p>Traffic Jam refers to a long line of vehicles on the road leading to a serious roadblock. It is a
                    common feature of the major roads of Bangladesh. It is also seen in the town or even rural roads.
                    There are some causes behind this Firstly, many drivers are ignorant of traffic rules while some
                    deliberately violate traffic rules. This leads to a serious roadblock. Again, plying of various
                    vehicles with different velocities causes traffic jams. The vehicles with high speed are sometimes
                    blocked by vehicles with less speed. In, traffic jams are largely occurred due to thousands of
                    rickshaws plying on the busy roads.</p>

                <h2>Tree plantation</h2>

                <h3 class="green-color">news 20 may 2021</h3>
                <p>A tree plantation, forest plantation, plantation forest or timber plantation is a forest planted for
                    high volume production of wood, usually by planting one type of tree as a monoculture
                    forest.Plantation forestry can produce a high volume of wood in a short period of time. Plantations
                    are grown by state orestry authorities (for example, the Forestry Commission in Britain) and/or the
                    paper and wood industries and other private landowners (such as Weyerhaeuser, Rayonier and Sierra
                    Pacific Industries in the United States or Asia Pulp & Paper in Indonesia).
